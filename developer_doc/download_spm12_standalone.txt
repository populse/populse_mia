Download SPM12: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/restricted/bids/spm12_r7219_Linux_R2017b.zip
Unzip it

Download MCR R2017b for linux: https://uk.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html
Unzip it in a MCR/ folder 

Install it following these steps:
https://fr.mathworks.com/help/compiler/install-the-matlab-runtime.html

After the installation, you get the following message:
On the target computer, append the following to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:  /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v93/runtime/glnxa64:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v93/bin/glnxa64:/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v93/sys/os/glnxa64:  If MATLAB Runtime is to be used with MATLAB Production Server, you do not need to modify the above environment variable.

Create a .conf file in the /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ folder and add those previous paths in the file:
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/your_lib.conf

Run ldconfig to update the cache:
sudo ldconfig

Go back to spm12 folder
Execute SPM12, the second path being the path of the MCR (that has been chosen during the installation):
./run_spm12.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v93

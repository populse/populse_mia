"""
This module provides an abstract base class for data viewer implemenataions in
populse_mia.

Data viewers are supposed to inherit :class:`DataViewer` and implement (at
least) its methods. A data viewer is given a project and documents list, and is
thus allowed to access databasing features and documents attributes.

Coding a data viewer
--------------------

A data viewer is identified after its module name, and is currently searched
for as a submodule of :mod:`populse_mia.user_interface.data_viewer`. The
data viewer module may be implemented as a "regular" module (.py file) or a
package (directory) and should contain at least a
class named ``MiaViewer`` which:

  - is a Qt ``QWidget`` (inherits ``QWidget`` as 1st inheritance as is required
    by Qt)
  - implements the :class:`DataViewer` API (normally by inheriting it as second
    inheritance after ``QWidget`` but this is not technically required if the
    API is implemented)

    :align: center

  * Run the PowerShell application.

* Make sure you have Python installed. You can verify it by typing in PowerShell: ::

    python3 -V

  *Note : depending on your versions, you might need to use `python -V` instead on `python3 -V` to check your version of Python.*

  * If Python is not installed:

    1. In PowerShell, type: ::

        python3

    2. The Microsoft Store will open on the Python 3.8 app, click on Install:

    .. image:: ../images/Python3.8.png
      :width: 500
      :align: center

    3. Check in the shell PowerShell that Python and pip (pip is normally include in the install of Python) are installed: ::

       python3 -V
       pip3 --version

* Make sure you have Git installed. You can verify it by typing in PowerShell: ::

    git --version

  * If Git is not installed, you need to install it (`Here <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_): ::

      Download the executable for your specific distribution (64 or 32 bits).
      Run it.
      You will be asked many questions depending on you preferences, but the default parameters are enough.

  * At the end of the git installation, you will need to restart PowerShell to restart the environment and be able to use Git.

* During the install, you will need C++ Build tools. You can get it by installing Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 and select C++ Build tools (`Here <https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/download/details.aspx?id=58317>`_): ::

  1. Download the executable file and run it.

  2.The installation is in two parts, at the end of the first part a window with every module in charge by Visual Studio will open:

  .. image:: ../images/vs_Build.png
      :width: 500
      :align: center

  3. Select the C++ Build Tools and install it.

* Install java 64-bits for Windows (`Here <https://java.com/fr/download/manual.jsp>`_): ::

    Download the offline (64 bits) file and run it
    Follow the installation

* Now you need to configure your java in order to be used by your system and PowerShell:

.. warning::

  This operation needs administrator rights

    1. In PowerShell, open a system properties window by typing: ::

        sysdm.cpl

    2. Click on the Advanced System Parameter;

    5. Click on New;

    6. Paste the path to the folder containing YOUR java executable, it should LOOK like this: ::

        C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_251\bin

* Enable the NTFS long path:

 .. warning::

    This operation needs administrator rights

    1. In PowerShell type: ::

        gpedit.msc

    2. A Local Group Policy Editor window will open, then Navigate to:

      --> Local Compute Policy
      --> Computer Configuration

* Populse_mia requires some specific package for Python and particularly numpy and PyQt5, you need to install them before launching the populse_mia installation: ::

    pip3 install numpy --user # be sure to doin't forget the "\--user" at the end of the command, otherwise you might get issues from administrator rights
    pip3 install PyQt5

* Get sources code from GitHub using HTTS or SSH in the directory of your choice (the current directory or replace the [mia_install_dir] with the directory of your choice): ::

    git lfs clone https://github.com/populse/populse_mia.git [mia_install_dir] # using HTTPS
    git lfs clone git@github.com:populse/populse_mia.git [mia_install_dir] # using SSH

* Then, install the Python module distribution: ::

    cd [mia_install_dir]
    python3 setup.py install --user

  *Note : make sure to don't forget '\--user' at the end of the command. If not you might get access errors linked with administrators rights.

* Then, run Populse_mia :

  * By interpreting the main.py file: ::

      cd [mia_install_dir]/python/populse_mia
      python3 main.py

  * By launching the package with python: ::

      python3 -m populse_mia

* Now, configure you populse_mia, click on file and MIA preferences:

  * In the Tools tab, enter the path to your project folder in the Projects preferences.

  .. image:: ../images/tool_tab.png
    :width: 400
    :align: center

  * Get sources code for MRI_conv from GitHub using HTTS or SSH in the directory of your choice (the current directory or replace the [mri_install_dir] with the directory of your choice): ::

      git lfs clone https://github.com/populse/mri_conv.git [mri_install_directory] # using HTTPS
      git lfs clone git@github.com:populse/mri_conv.git [mri_install_directory] # using SSH

  * In the Tools tab of the MIA preferences window in populse_mia, enter the absolute path to MRIManager.jar in the POPULSE third party preferences: ::

    [mri_install_dir]/mri_conv/MRIFileManager/MRIManager.jar

  * Next, in the Pipeline tab of MIA preferences, check Use Matlab and enter the path to the matlab.exe file of your computer: ::

    ../../Matlab/YourVersionOfMatlab/bin/matlab.exe

    .. image:: ../images/pipeline_tab.png
      :width: 400
      :align: center

  * In the Pipeline tab of MIA preferences, if you have licensed SPM version check Use SPM and enter the path to your spm folder: ::

    ../../Matlab/spm12

  * In the Pipeline tab of MIA preferences, if you have standalone SPM version check Use SPM Standalone and enter the path to your spm12 folde: ::

    ../../spm12_r****/spm12

      *Note : in this scenario you only need to check Use SPM Standalone in the Pipeline tab MIA preferences.

* For developing process, make sure to work on your own branch ::

      git checkout -b your_branch_name # creates your own branch locally
      git push -u origin your_branch_name # creates your own branch remotely

# Usage

  * For all platforms: after a source installation, launching from the source code directory via command line

    * Interprets the main.py file

          cd [mia_install_dir]/python/populse_mia  
          python3 main.py  

    * Now, to configure your populse_mia, click on file and MIA preferences
  	* In the Tools tab, enter the path to your project folder under Project preferences ;
	* Get sources code for MRI_conv from GitHub using HTTPS or SSH in the directory of your choice (the current directory or replace the [mri_install_dir] with the directory of your choice) :

			git lfs clone https://github.com/populse/mri_conv.git [mri_install_dir] # using HTTPS
			git lfs clone git@github.com:populse/mri_conv.git [mri_install_dir] # using SSH

	* In the Tools tab of the MIA preferences window in populse_mia, enter the absolute path to MRIManager.jar in the POPULSE third party preferences

			[mri_install_dir]/mri_conv/MRIFileManager/MRIManager.jar



        * Next, in the Pipeline tab of MIA preferences, check Use Matlab and enter the path to the matlab.exe file of your computer :

			../../Matlab/YourVersionOfMatlab/bin/matlab.exe

	    * In the Pipeline tab of MIA preferences, check Use SPM and enter the path to your spm folder :

  * For all platforms, after a [Populse_MIAâ€™s user installation](https://populse.github.io/populse_mia/html/installation/user_installation.html)

        python3 -m populse_mia

  * Depending on the operating system used, it was observed some compatibility issues with PyQt5/SIP. In this case, we recommend, as a first attempt, to do:

        python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall pyqt5==5.14.0
        python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall PyQt5-sip==5.0.1

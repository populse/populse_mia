Pre-requirements of windows installations are the same for `windows host installation in user mode <https://populse.github.io/populse_mia/html/installation/host_pre_req_windows10.html>`_.
But you can avoid numpy and PyQt5 install commands since they will be managed while installing the mia project under ubuntu.

Once pre-requirements are acquired, you will need to install Wsl2 to host a virtual machine of ubuntu to install mia.

1- WSL2 (Windows Subsystem Linux) installation
-------------------------------------------

* In an administrator type Windows account:
      - Windows 10 must be up to date
      - You need to have enough free space on your system disk : around 20 Gb
      - Open a **PowerShell as administrator** (right clic on powershell icon)
enter: ::

  wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04

|


    .. image:: ../../../developer_doc/images/screenshots/Windows_10_PowerShell_WSL2.png
       :align: center
       :name: Windows_10_PowerShell_WSL2

|

* Reboot the computer

* Normally a linux ubuntu window is already available, enter it:

- enter a user / password who will be administrator of this linux (asked by the system)


    .. image:: ../../../developer_doc/images/screenshots/Windows_10_Ubuntu.png
       :align: center
       :name: Windows_10_Ubuntu

|

Then you can write your first commands to make ubuntu up to date: ::

   sudo apt update

   #at this first sudo command, the system may ask you to enter the password you just enter before.

   sudo apt upgrade -y

   exit
|

- close this window

You can open back Ubuntu to continue the installs.

Open Powershell and type ``ubuntu`` to open you vitual ubuntu machine.

Now you have WSL2 and an Ubuntu 20.04 linux.
You can access Windows files via ``/mnt/c/`` in the Ubuntu WSL Windows terminal, we can access   

Set your WSL2 as default with ``wsl --install -d distribution``.



To know more:  
   - `[Manual installation steps for older versions of WSL] <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual>`_.
   - `[Install WSL] <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_.
   - `[Basic commands for WSL] <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands>`_.


2- X server installation in windows with VcXsrv
-----------------------------------------------
|

We also need a X windows server to allow linux applications graphic user interface (GUI) works.  

Get `[VcXsrv] <https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/files/latest/download>`_.
  - Execute it, 
  - click 'next' then 'install' to install it 

Looking for XLaunch application icon, launch it.

Configure it like the screenshots below:
  
   .. image:: ../../../developer_doc/images/screenshots/Xlaunch_1.png
      :align: center
      :name: Xlaunch_1

|

   .. image:: ../../../developer_doc/images/screenshots/Xlaunch_2.png
      :align: center
      :name: Xlaunch_2

|

Disable *'Native opengl'*
Enable *'Disable access control'*
     
   .. image:: ../../../developer_doc/images/screenshots/Xlaunch_3.png
      :align: center
      :name: Xlaunch_3

|

Do *'Save Configuration'* in a file that allow you to launch it later (ie on the Desktop)


   .. image:: ../../../developer_doc/images/screenshots/Xlaunch_4.png
      :align: center
      :name: Xlaunch_4

|

Allow access asked by Windows firewall.
 
P.S: You have to make sure VcXsrv is running every time you to run a GUI via your Ubuntu linux distribution.
  
3 - Dependencies Installation
-----------------------------
|

Open an Ubuntu session in Windows by:

- click on Ubuntu new icon

  or

- open a normal Windows PowerShell,enter ``ubuntu.20.04.exe``


In this Ubuntu window terminal, install the following dependencies: ::

   sudo apt install -y build-essential uuid-dev libgpgme-dev squashfs-tools libseccomp-dev wget pkg-config git git-lfs cryptsetup-bin python3-distutils python3-dev
   # Ubuntu 20.04
   sudo apt install python-is-python3

|

4 - Singularity Installation
----------------------------
|

Then to allow `singularity <https://apptainer.org/admin-docs/3.8/index.html>`_ installation we need go language and some dependancies for compilation.
If you anticipate needing to remove Singularity, it might be easier to install it in a custom directory using the --prefix option to mconfig.
In that case Singularity can be uninstalled simply by deleting the parent directory.


Here are commands : ::

 #Ubuntu 20.04
 sudo apt install -y golang

 echo 'export GOPATH=${HOME}/go' >> ~/.bashrc &&\
 echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin' >> ~/.bashrc  &&\
 source ~/.bashrc

|

See the section Prerequisites for Singularity on Linux.
The 3.8.3 version link is available `here <https://brainvisa.info/download/singularity-ce_3.8.3~ubuntu-20.04_amd64.deb>`_.

You can install singularity like this : ::
  
 sudo apt install make
 export VERSION=3.8.3 && # adjust this as necessary \
 wget https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/download/v${VERSION}/singularity-ce-${VERSION}.tar.gz && \
 tar -xzf singularity-ce-${VERSION}.tar.gz && \
 cd singularity-ce-${VERSION}
 sudo mkdir /opt/singularity
 ./mconfig --prefix=/opt/singularity
 cd builddir
 make
 sudo make install
|

Test it with ``/opt/singularity/bin/singularity version``.

Then remove installation files.
Enter the repertory where you download the singularity install with ``rm -R singularity-ce-${VERSION}*`` .

4 - BrainVisa Installation
----------------------------
|

-Create an installation directory:

``mkdir -p $HOME/casa_distro/brainvisa-opensource-master`` (note that we are using a slightly different directories organization from the user case, because the images here can be reused and shared betwen several development configurations - but this organization is not mandatory, it will just make things simpler for the management tool casa_distro if it is used later)

-Download the "casa-dev" image found here (https://brainvisa.info/download/), preferably into the $HOME/casa_distro directory. Download the lates "casa-dev" image.
Itâ€™s a .sif file, for instance casa-dev-5.3-8.sif. Type ``wget https://brainvisa.info/download/casa-dev-5.3-8.sif``

-Execute the container image using Singularity, with an option to tell it to run its setup procedure. The installation directory should be passed, and it will require additional parameters to specify the development environment characteristics. Namely a distro argument will tell which projects set the build will be based on (valid values are opensource, brainvisa, cea etc.), a branch argument will be master, latest_release etc., and other arguments are optional: ``singularity run -B $HOME/casa_distro/brainvisa-opensource-master:/casa/setup $HOME/casa_distro/casa-dev-5.0.sif branch=master distro=opensource``.

-Set the bin/ directory of the installation directory in the PATH environment variable of your host system config, typically in $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.bash_profile if you are using a Unix Bash shell: ::

  echo	'export PATH="$HOME/casa_distro/brainvisa-opensource-master/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc   &&\
  source ~/.bashrc

  # we get the ip address to allow X server access and this ip can change when Windows reboot
  nano ~/.bashrc
  export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2 ":0.0"}')
  source ~/.bashrc
  
  nano brainvisa_ro/conf/bv_maker.cfg
  [ build $CASA_BUILD ]
     cmake_options += -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3
     cmake_options += -DDESIRED_QT_VERSION=5

  bv_maker 
  # it takes time to compile


Now you can test if the brainvisa configuration GUI works well via the command: ``bv``.


You have completely installed a virtual Ubuntu which is now able to host mia.
You can now follow steps from **installation** via `populse mia installation in user mode <https://populse.github.io/populse_mia/html/installation/virtualisation_user_installation.html>`_.
